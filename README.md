## Vision for the project

**• What is your product (high-level view)?**
<br/>This application is a place where students and tutors at the University of Cincinnati can connect. Students will get on the application and select a tutor or learner role - from which the learners are paired with a tutor to help with their work. Often times, students might suddenly need tutoring for a niche class but not know who they can talk to - this application will help students find the right person with the help they need.
**• Whom is it for?**
<br/> We specifically designed the application for Students and Tutors at the University of Cincinati to use and get connected with one another.
**• What problem does it solve?** 
<br/> Students that are struggling in their classes will be paired with a tutoron campus and are able to chat back and forth
**• What alternatives are available, who are your competitors?**
<br/>Currently, the University of Cincinnati has a tutoring website called TracCloud that matches tutors with students. We plan to create a more robust application where students can get help with anything big or small. We believe anyone can help anyone, students can sign up to be a learner or tutor every time they log on, so this app is for anyone at any level of education.
**• What is novel in your approach, that is why is this project compelling and worth developing?**
