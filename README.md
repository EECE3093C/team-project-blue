# Vision for the project

This application is a place where students and tutors at the University of Cincinnati can connect. Students will get on the application and select a tutor or learner role - from which the learners are paired with a tutor to help with their work. Often times, students might suddenly need tutoring for a niche class but not know who they can talk to - this application will help students find the right person with the help they need.

Currently, the University of Cincinnati has a tutoring website called TracCloud that matches tutors with students. We plan to create a more robust application where students can get help with anything big or small. We believe anyone can help anyone, students can sign up to be a learner or tutor every time they log on, so this app is for anyone at any level of education.
