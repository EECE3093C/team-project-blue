## Vision for the project

**• What is your product (high-level view)?**
<br/>This application is a place where students and tutors at the University of Cincinnati can connect. Students will get on the application and select a tutor or learner role - from which the learners are paired with a tutor to help with their work. Often times, students might suddenly need tutoring for a niche class but not know who they can talk to - this application will help students find the right person with the help they need.
**• Whom is it for?**
<br/> We specifically designed the application for Students and Tutors at the University of Cincinati to use and get connected with one another.
**• What problem does it solve?** 
<br/> Students that are struggling in their classes will be paired with a tutoron campus and are able to chat back and forth.
**• What alternatives are available, who are your competitors?**
<br/>Currently, the University of Cincinnati has a tutoring website called TracCloud that matches tutors with students.
**• What is novel in your approach, that is why is this project compelling and worth developing?**
<br/> We plan to create a more robust application where students can get help with anything big or small. We believe anyone can help anyone, students can sign up to be a learner or tutor every time they log on, so this app is for anyone at any level of education.



# Software Architecture

**• Make it clear that the system can be built, making good use of the available resources and technology.** 
<br/>
**• Describe at a very high level the system's architecture, identifying the components/modules that will interact.**
<br/>
**• Describe the specific data you will access/store.**
<br/> The data that we need to access/store will be student and tutor information (Student/Tutor name, Student/Tutor role, chats between Tutor and helper).
<br/>**• What languages are being used?**
<br/>HTML, CSS, Javascript, typecript, angular and node.js

# Challenges and Risks

**• What is the single most serious challenge you see in developing the product on schedule?**
<br/>The most challenging part of this project is that we are new to this kind of web development. This is the first time we are working on a project with this caliber and intricacy. We have to be able to learn and develop code in a constricted timeline.
<br/>**• How will you minimize or mitigate the risk?**
<br/>The best way to minimize these risks is to use the Agile and Scrum methodolgies. By using these two methods we will be more efficient by giving group members specific tasks to work on while being on schedule.
